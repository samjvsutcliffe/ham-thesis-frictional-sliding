# Frictional sliding - penalty test
This repo has the code for testing a Coulomb frictional law implemented with a penalty method.
A long elastic slab is quasi-statically displaced over a rigid frictional surface, and the force required to displace it is measured.
Ideally, this would be an infinite plate as the front and end have some transition zone of varying normal behaviour from bending.
